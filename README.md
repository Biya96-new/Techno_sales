The Techno Sales Learning Services Company team always cleans data and creates the report in microsoft excel,which is a time consuming process.So this project is done to see how Power BI can solve this issue and automate the end to end work.
Analyzing data using Power Bi helped in creating a report which helped in calculating sum of sales by region,category,segment,state,years etc.
By doing so it became easier for the company officials to get complete view of sales from any place.There by it helped to make the necessery changes in the business to improve the sales where ever it is required.
Also by using Power BI it is not necessary to update the report every time a new entry is made instead on clicking the refresh button it gets updated automatically or a scheduled refresh can be set up at particular intervals.Therefore using Power BI helped to reduce the time spent about in analyzing the data and also provided the business a better understanding of the sales.
